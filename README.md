department documents

Lauren, I moved most, now ALL, of the files into 2015-16; since they are all relevant to the 2015-16 AY year only.

We will have a new folder for 2016-17.

Also a few of these are also available to our students on the web at:

Lauren, should we have the .tex files alone, or both .tex and pdf's?

I believe I'm in...
Let's keep pdf's and .tex, for the non-texers
